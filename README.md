# Automation and Deployment

These are my templates and configurations I use in various projects and deployment scenarios. They are based on automation and deployment tools such as [Ansible], [Docker], [Terraform] and much more.

I created them as free resources to be extended to specific use cases.

## Sections

- [Ansible] IT automation tool to configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate IT tasks.

- [Docker] Package applications as portable container images to run in any environment.

- [Kubernetes] Container orchestrator to run applications in scalable environments.

- [Terraform] Infrastructure as code software to plan, deploy and manage infrastructure.
